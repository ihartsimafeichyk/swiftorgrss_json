if you’ve deployed your app on heroku from heroku website and you want to run a
heroku command like heruko logs or heruko open but it results with the following error:

Error: Missing required flag:
 ›     -a, --app APP  app to run command against
 ›   See more help with --help

This is because, heruko CLI doesn’t know the app you want to run this command for.
So to resolve this error, you need to tell heroku about the app you want to run these commands.

For that, follow these steps:

1- Initialise with git: git init
2- Get the app name: heroku apps
3- Add remote:

heroku git:remote -a your_app_name
